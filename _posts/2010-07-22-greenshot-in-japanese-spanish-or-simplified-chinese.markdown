  content: ! "I need to \"rectify\", the Dutch translation was made by me but corrected
    by Jurjen Ladenius as my Dutch (though being Dutch) was never very good and I
    have been living in Germany way to long.\r\n\r\nThe thanks go to <B>Jurjen</B>,
    who is also mentioned in the XML as the main translator."
