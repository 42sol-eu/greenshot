On the 19th of December 2016 we released Greenshot 1.2.9.103 as an early christmas present.
We invested over 500 hours of development time in that version, with that much time there were bound to be a few bugs in there.
Today at the end of the year we bring you a bugfix release, which should solve most reported bugs and even bring a few small features, you can see the full changelog below.

So if you didn't already, just go ahead and [download](/downloads/) 1.2.9.112 the last Greenshot release for the year 2016!

We hope to bring you a lot more Greenshot in 2017 and wish everybody a happy and healthy 2017,
the Greenshot team
