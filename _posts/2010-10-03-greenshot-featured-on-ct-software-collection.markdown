<p>Wow :) We're happy to see that Version 0.8 of Greenshot is part of the c't magazine's current edition of software collection on CD. (c't is one of the most popular professional computer magazines in German speaking countries, just in case you should not know it.)</p>
<p>The c't software collection 6/10 offers 88 software tools, most of them about editing photos and other images, among those: one tool for taking screenshots :)</p>
<p>By the way: you may have noticed that it has been a little bit quiet here lately, but that does not mean that the development is not going on. We had less time available for working on this screenshot tool for several reasons - it has been holiday season, bigger work load at our jobs, and of course there are always some other time consuming things in life... Version 0.8.1 is in development (we will post some more information about the changes in this minor release soon) and we have already made some preparations for version 0.9.</p>
