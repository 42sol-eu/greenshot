We just released our third build of Greenshot for Mac OS, version 1.2.2.

Thanks to all of our users, you're awesome! We got a lot of great feedback and as it seems, there are just a few minor flaws at the moment. That's a great start.

Please keep writing those nice AppStore reviews. We're reading every single one of them!

When you want to report an error or have a feature request, please file it in our [bug tracker](https://greenshot.atlassian.net/projects/MAC). That way you can be sure the issue will be taken care of and also you'll get noticed when we work on it.

Some of you guys already had a few feature requests and we're doing them one by one.

In the current version we added some of them and also fixed some bugs:

* The most requested feature was the tool to add the number badges. Here it is.
* When drawing very short arrows, the arrowhead now shrinks a bit. In the future you will most probably be able to adjust the size of the arrows to your liking.
* You can now turn off the hints about editing text in the preferences window.
* The default filename prefix is now configurable.
* We redesigned the app icon.
* Some minor issues not worth mentioning ;-)
