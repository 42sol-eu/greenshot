<p>Greenshot 0.8.1 RC3 is now available for <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/greenshot/files%2FGreenshot%2FGreenshot%200.8%20beta%2FGreenshot-RC3-INSTALLER-0.8.1.1339.exe/download">download</a>. Thanks to everybody who has been testing the previous release candidates and provided feedback.</p>
<p>Here is the list of resolved bugs and added features since the first release candidate. Feel free to download the new build and, as always, <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=191585&atid=937972&status=1">let us know</a> if you encounter problems with it.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot :)</p>
<p><code><br />
* Variables in the output path caused problems are all "illegal path characters" were replaced with "_", making it unusable.<br />
* Multiple Imgur plug-in fixes (wrong sorting, resizing the history causes GUI problems)<br />
* Now detecting "RC" releases as new!<br />
* Multiple windows didn't show the Greenshot icon<br />
* Language selection is shown again if no language is selected (at first run or if the configuration is deleted)<br />
* Fixed OCR plug-in still showing, even if it's not loaded correctly (as MODI is not installed).</p>
<p>Features added:<br />
* Image editor now shows the dimensions in the status bar<br />
* Image editor title now starts with the capture title, ending with " - Greenshot editor", which is usual behaviour for editors.<br />
* Imgur history clear button<br />
