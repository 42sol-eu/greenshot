<p><strong>Updated 2013/07/29:</strong> <i>Facebook has changed where to find the settings described below. Updated the link to display the current information from Facebook's Help Center.</i></p>
<p>If you want to share screenshots via Facebook, there is an easy way to do so with Greenshot: simply use the so-called post-by-email address Facebook has set up for you.</p>
<p>In case you do not know your post-by-email address, you can find it out very easy, Facebook's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/210153612350847">Help Center entry</a> tells you how to do it.</p>
<p>Once you know it, the rest is quite easy: Take a screenshot with Greenshot and use the <a href="/help/#editor-export">E-Mail feature</a> with your upload email address to upload it to Facebook. If you want to add a description, you can do so by typing it into the E-Mail's subject. That's it :)</p>
<p>P.S.: Of course we are aware that Facebook offers interfaces to upload images directly from a desktop application. But as there is no Facebook Plugin for Greenshot yet, uploading it via email is currently the easiest solution to share your screenshots on Facebook.</p>
