  content: ! "Greenshot is great! Thanks for making it. If I might suggest an enhancement:
    borders. A lot of the screen caps I take are on white backgrounds, and in documentation
    and emails and such I feel I need to set the images (often of text) apart from
    the text I write there. My current favorite is PicPick's Marco 1 frame, which
    not only provides white space and a subtle frame, but also a great shadow effect.
    \r\nBut I really like all the features of Greenshot, thanks again, and I wish
    you much success."

  content: ! "This software is really nice, and well programmed.\r\n\r\nWhat about
    having also the -NO-INSTALLER- version easy to find online?\r\nI tried a v.0.8xxx
    \ -NO-INSTALLER-v ersion, on USB, but process greenshot.exe died, io error, file
    not fount.\r\nIs this issue known?"

  content: ! "Thanks for your feedback :)\r\nWe have actually decided to put the installer
    version front, since it is a lot easier to use and does not have any drawbacks.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    to your error: have you copied all the files and folders from the ZIP to the stick?
    It should not be a problem to run Greenshot from a USB stick.\r\nIf you still
    encounter problems, please file a <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=937972&group_id=191585&func=browse\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">bug report</a>."

    Reading this post - the gift of the time...'

<p>Today we have moved our website from the sourceforge.net subdomain to our new domain <a href="http://getgreenshot.org">http://getgreenshot.org/</a>, which will from now on be the one and only official URL of Greenshot. The Greenshot project is still hosted on sourceforge.net, and you can still visit <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/greenshot/">Greenshot's sourceforge pages</a>, but they are no longer integrated in our main navigation.</p>
<p>Is has been a while since we have introduced the new logo on Twitter and Facebook - today, finally, it has arrived on our website, too. And - as the new logo is far too fresh and funky to go with the previous layout of the website - we decided to have a redesign here as well :) We hope you like it.</p>
<p>We have added a new page for <a href="/screenshots/">screenshots</a>, and - as you probably figured out already - we also have blogging capabilities now, so there is a central place for announcing things like new releases (yes, very soon ;-)). Of course, we will still keep the status message up to date on our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Greenshot/159817888308/">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/greenshot_tool/">Twitter</a> profiles.</p>
