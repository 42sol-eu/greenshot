<p>Today we have moved our website from the sourceforge.net subdomain to our new domain <a href="http://getgreenshot.org">http://getgreenshot.org/</a>, which will from now on be the one and only official URL of Greenshot. The Greenshot project is still hosted on sourceforge.net, and you can still visit <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/greenshot/">Greenshot's sourceforge pages</a>, but they are no longer integrated in our main navigation.</p>
<p>Is has been a while since we have introduced the new logo on Twitter and Facebook - today, finally, it has arrived on our website, too. And - as the new logo is far too fresh and funky to go with the previous layout of the website - we decided to have a redesign here as well :) We hope you like it.</p>
<p>We have added a new page for <a href="/screenshots/">screenshots</a>, and - as you probably figured out already - we also have blogging capabilities now, so there is a central place for announcing things like new releases (yes, very soon ;-)). Of course, we will still keep the status message up to date on our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Greenshot/159817888308/">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/greenshot_tool/">Twitter</a> profiles.</p>
