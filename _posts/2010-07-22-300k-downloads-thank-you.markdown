    work. the only feature request I'd add is a \"blur\" option - like the rectangle
    or oval tool, being able to blur out sensitive data in the image capture. \r\n\r\ngreat

  content: ! "Actually, there are a lot of ways to give feedback to Greenshot: this
    blog, Facebook, Twitter, the bug/feature request tracker and forums on sourceforge.
    Perhaps we should point out existing possibilities better. Another channel would
    probably lead to parts of the feedback going unnoticed.\r\n\r\nInteresting link
    anyway, thanks :)"

    environment :) \r\nbut sourceforge can work too, i didnt see that one...\r\n(but
    it would be much better to use a \"proper tool\", it build a community)"

    about it... \r\nOf course, the sourceforge stuff is a bit old style ;-) But speaking
    of \"one place\" - that's exactly the problem, we already have some ;-) each one
    of them being important in one way or another."

    there has probably been a temporary issue with the SourceForge site (where our
    downloadable files reside). Please try to download again.\r\n\r\nWe have changed
    a lot for Greenshot 0.8, also made improvements to the clipboard code, there are
    good chances that your problem is resolved with the new version."
