<p>We have received a bunch of new translations from friendly users :)</p>
<p>We are happy to announce that Greenshot translation files are now available for Swedish (Tack, Eric F.), Finnish (Kiitos, Jari Majaniemi), Greek (Χάρη, ΓΙΩΡΓΟ ΣΚΟΥΝΤΖΗ) and Hebrew (תודה, רן ששון).<br />
Furthermore, grazie to tonytogna and gracias to Alejandro de Gárate for submitting revised versions of the Italian and Spanish translations.</p>
<p>Thanks to dedicated users, Greenshot is now available in 18 languages - wow... this is really great :)</p>
<p>You can get hold of all translations on our <a href="/downloads/">download page</a> - just download the desired language file and save it to the "Languages" subdirectory of Greenshot's installation directory.</p>
<p>Your language is still missing? Have a look at our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=191585&atid=1368020">translations tracker</a> - maybe someone has already submitted it, but we have not found the time to check it and put it onto the website.<br />
If there is none, and you would like to submit a translation of your own, you are very welcome to upload it there, of course.</p>
<p>Thanks again to all translators - good job :)</p>
