<p>Two weeks ago we have published <a href="/2013/05/07/greenshot-1-1-is-available-introducing-the-capture-zoom/">Greenshot 1.1</a>. Just today we have uploaded an updated version (1.1.5), which fixes bugs that have been reported since then - most notably an error message occurring in Windows Vista when trying to apply a drop shadow or torn edge effect to a screenshot, and color prints being printed in grayscale under certain conditions.</p>
<p>We have also received some updates for the translations, which are included in this release: Estonian has been added as a new language (thanks a lot to Olav for submitting the translation), and there are updates for the Ukrainian, Russish, Polish and Italian translation as well. </p>
<p>For all of you interested in more details, read the change log below. Or just download the latest release from our <a href="/downloads/">downloads page</a>.</p>
<p>Have fun :)</p>
