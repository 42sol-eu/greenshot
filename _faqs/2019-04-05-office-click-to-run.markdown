title: Is Microsoft Office with Click-To-Run supported by Greenshot? 
tags: []
 
---
It's possible to install Microsoft Office via [Click-To-Run](https://support.microsoft.com/en-hk/help/2028653/information-about-office-click-to-run-installations-and-about-related), can Greenshot still export to my Office applications if I use this?

Unfortunately this doesn't work and is not supported, applications which use Click-To-Run are virtualized to improve security and cannot be automated by OLE / COM Technologies, which is what Greenshot uses.

There is currently no solution for this, except that you install Office the normal way.
