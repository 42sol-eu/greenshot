<p>Currently, there is no way to turn this off. If you cannot live with it doing so, we recommend using the ZIP distribution instead of the installer.</p>
<p>Please remember: Greenshot is free of charge, and the program itself is free of advertising or nagging. There are only few ways to generate at least a little income to cover our expenses, namely donations and website advertising (which needs traffic to work). For Greenshot it's crucial that people know (and visit) <a href="http://getgreenshot.org">getgreenshot.org</a>. We kindly ask for your understanding.</p>
