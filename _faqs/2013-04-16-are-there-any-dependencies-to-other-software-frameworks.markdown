<p>Yes. Greenshot is written with and for the <strong>Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0</strong> and can't run without having this installed. Any version from 2.0 up to 4.5 should work. Of course, this limits usage to PCs running the Microsoft Windows operating system.</p>
<p>If you are unsure whether .NET is installed on your system, simply use our exe installer. It will check whether it is there, and if not offer to download and install it for you (if you want).</p>
