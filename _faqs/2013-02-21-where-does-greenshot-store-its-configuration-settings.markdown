<p>Greenshot keeps its configuration in a file called Greenshot.ini.<br />
Its storage location depends on which version of Greenshot you are using as well as your Windows version:</p>
<p><strong>If you are using the installer version of Greenshot</strong>, the file is stored in your (roaming) application data folder, which is a path like</p>
<ul>
<li><code>C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Greenshot\</code> in Windows Vista and newer version or </li>
<li><code>C:\Documents and Settings\%USERNAME%\Application Data\Greenshot\</code> in Windows XP</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are using the ZIP version of Greenshot</strong>, the file is stored within the directory where you unzipped Greenshot to. This allows you to put Greenshot e.g. on a memory stick and use it as a portable application.</p>
<p>If you want to have a look at the configuration file or need to change something (be careful!), right-click Greenshot's systray icon, select "About Greenshot" and hit the <kbd>I</kbd> key on your keyboard - Greenshot.ini will open in your default text editor.</p>
