<p>Usually, screenshot annotations are of a brief nature and thus don't need paragraphs and line breaks - this is why <kbd>Enter</kbd> and <kbd>Return</kbd> finish editing of a text box instead of inserting a line break, similar to other software e.g. MS Excel.<br />
Of course, there are situations in which there is need to add line breaks. You can do so by simply hitting <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Return</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>, respectively.</p>
