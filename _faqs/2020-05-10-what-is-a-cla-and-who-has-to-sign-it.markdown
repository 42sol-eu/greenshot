title: What is a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) - and who has to sign it?
tags: []
 
---

If you want to contribute code (or anything else that might be subject to copyright) to our repository we ask you to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA), like many other open source projects.
By signing it, you explicitely allow us to use your contribution - the purpose of this process is to have agreed terms for that, and to avoid any misunderstandings.

Signing the CLA is pretty straightforward and does not involve any paperwork - we're using [CLA Assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/) by SAP SE for it, which means that you can simply sign with few clicks right out of GitHub.

1. As soon as you create a pull request to be merged into our [greenshot](https://github.com/greenshot/greenshot) repository (or add a commit to an existing pull request), a comment will ask you to sign the CLA.
2. Click the link, carefully read the document and then sign it by clicking the button.
3. That's it.

CLA Assistant will not ask you again to sign the CLA unless we apply changes to the agreement.

If you want to learn more about license agreements, you might want to have a look at [contributoragreements.org](http://contributoragreements.org/). The website also offers a license agreement chooser, which we have used to generate [Greenshot's Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/greenshot/greenshot).
