<p>Are you using Dropbox? Several users reported similar problems after installing Dropbox or updating it. Newer versions of Dropbox come with a feature that copies screenshots to your Dropbox account. For this reasons, it registers the <kbd>PrntScreen</kbd> key and Greenshot is no longer notified when you hit the key.</p>
<p>Many people are confused by this, so obviously Dropbox does not make its changes to the system configuration transparent enough. Feel free to contact Dropbox support about this.</p>
<p>There are various workarounds available, pick one :)</p>
<ul>
<li>Uninstall Dropbox</li>
<li>Deactivate Dropbox</li>
<li>Turn off Dropbox' screenshot feature in the Dropbox settings</li>
<li>Change Greenshot's hotkey for screenshots to anything else in the Greenshot settings</li>
</ul>
