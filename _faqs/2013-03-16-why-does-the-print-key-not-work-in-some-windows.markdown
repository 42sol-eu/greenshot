<p>If you are using Windows Vista or later and have Greenshot running without admininstrator privileges, while the currently active (i.e. focused) program window is running <strong>with</strong> administrator privileges, Windows' User Account Control will not notify Greenshot that the <kbd>Print</kbd> key has been pressed.</p>
<p>However there are some easy workarounds for this problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run Greenshot with administrator privileges.</li>
<li>Click somewehere else (e.g. task bar) to deactivate the current window, before hitting the <kbd>Print</kbd> key.</li>
<li>Use Greenshot's systray context menu to create a screen capture.</li>
</ul>
