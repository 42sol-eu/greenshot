Here are some details about Greenshot that might be handy for silent/mass installations.

The Greenshot installer is made with Inno Setup, see http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php
For command line options of the installer see: http://www.jrsoftware.org/ishelp/index.php?topic=setupcmdline

Since Greenshot 0.8.1 it is possible to configure Greenshot settings from the command-line.
This will even work when Greenshot is already running!

Greenshot commandline options:

        /help
                This help

		/help configure
                A list of the options that can be set

        /exit
                Try to close all running instances, could be used for installers

        /configure [property=value] ...
                Change the configuration of Greenshot via the commandline, multiple properties can be specified after each other.
                Example to change the language to English: greenshot.exe /configure Ui_Language=en-US
                Example to change the destination: greenshot.exe /configure Output_File_Path="C:\Documents and Settings\"

        /openfile [filename]
                Open the bitmap file in the running Greenshot instance or start a new instance
				
		/norun
				Use as last option if you don't want the started executable to spawn a Greenshot instance.
				e.g. when you only want to change settings but don't want to have a running Greenshot afterwards.
				
With the /configure option many settings can be change, the /help configure will give a list of all available settings!
Here are some described in detail:

	General_RegisterHotkeys=Boolean
This setting specified if the hotkeys will be registed, can be used to let Greenshot run side by side with other applications.
All functions are than only available via the context menu of the Systray icon.
Default is true.
Example to change: greenshot.exe /configure General_RegisterHotkeys=false

	General_IsFirstLaunch=Boolean
This setting is actually for Greenshot internal usage, it specifies if someone already has used Greenshot or if it is the first start.
If this is true Greenshot will show a balloon at the Systray Icon.
Default is true, will be false after the first start.
Example to change: greenshot.exe /configure General_IsFirstLaunch=false

	Capture_Mousepointer=Boolean
This setting, which is available in the settings window, specifies if Greenshot will capture the mouse cursor.
Default is true.
Example to change: greenshot.exe /configure Capture_Mousepointer=false

	Capture_Windows_Interactive=Boolean
This setting, which is available in the settings window, specifies if Greenshot will capture the current active window or will make it possible for the user to select a window with the mouse.
Default is false.
Example to change: greenshot.exe /configure Capture_Windows_Interactive=true

	Capture_Wait_Time=Int32
This setting, which is available in the settings window, specifies how many milliseconds Greenshot will wait after the capture is started.
Usually there is no need to change this setting, but sometimes it might help with refresh problems and the captured picture is not what is expected.
Default is 100.
Example to change: greenshot.exe /configure Capture_Wait_Time=300

	Ui_Language=String
This setting, which is available in the settings window, specifies the used language.
Languages should be set with their full "IETF" code, like "de-DE", "en-US" or "en-UK".
The available language should be installed, otherwise a fallback at "en-US" will be made.
It's also possible to specify only the first characters, like "en" for English, but there is no garantee what "variant" will be used.
Default is the language selected in the installer.
Example to change: greenshot.exe /configure Ui_Language=en-US

	Ui_Effects_Flashlight=Boolean
This setting, which is available in the settings window, specifies if the "flashlight" effect is shown after each capture.
Default is false.
Example to change: greenshot.exe /configure Ui_Effects_Flashlight=true

	Ui_Effects_CameraSound=Boolean
This setting, which is available in the settings window, specifies if the camera sound is played after each capture.
Default is true.
Example to change: greenshot.exe /configure Ui_Effects_CameraSound=false

	Output_File_Path=String
This setting, which is available in the settings window, specifies the default location for all captures.
Default is the users desktop.
Example to change: greenshot.exe /configure Output_File_Path="C:\Documents and Settings\"

	Output_File_FilenamePattern=String
This setting, which is available in the settings window, specifies the default filename pattern.
Default is "%title%_%YYYY%-%MM%-%DD%_%hh%-%mm%-%ss%".
Example to change: greenshot.exe /configure Output_File_FilenamePattern="%hostname%\%user%\%title%-%NUM%"

	Output_File_Format=String
This setting, which is available in the settings window, specifies the default file type.
Default is "Png", available formats are: "Bmp", "Jpeg", "Gif" and "Png"
Example to change: greenshot.exe /configure Output_File_Format=Gif

	Output_File_CopyPathToClipboard=Boolean
This setting, which is available in the settings window, specifies if the path of the written file will be pasted to the clipboard.
Default is false
Example to change: greenshot.exe /configure Output_File_CopyPathToClipboard=true

	Output_File_JpegQuality=Int32
This setting, which is available in the settings window, specifies the quality for the files that are written as Jpeg.
Default is 80
Example to change: greenshot.exe /configure Output_File_JpegQuality=50

	Output_File_PromptJpegQuality=Boolean
This setting, which is available in the settings window, specifies if the Jpeg settings should be asked at every save.
Default is false
Example to change: greenshot.exe /configure Output_File_PromptJpegQuality=true

	Output_File_IncrementingNumber=Int32
This setting specifies the number which is used in the filename pattern as "%NUM%".
Default is 0, will increment at every save.
Example to change: greenshot.exe /configure Output_File_IncrementingNumber=10

	Output_FileAs_Fullpath=String
This setting specifies the location of the last saved file, used when the "save" option is selected.
Default is "desktop\dummy.png", will change at every save. Can't think of a reason to set it...
Example to change: greenshot.exe /configure Output_FileAs_Fullpath="C:\tmp\greenshot.png"

	Editor_WindowState=String
This setting specifies the state the Greenshot Image Editor opens, used internally for making the Editor open at the same location as it was closed.
Default is empty, the setting is changed at every window close. Possible settings: "Normal" or "Maximized".
Example to change: greenshot.exe /configure Editor_WindowState=Maximized

Finally there are multiple Printer options which should explain themselves:
                Output_Print_PromptOptions=Boolean
                Output_Print_AllowRotate=Boolean
                Output_Print_AllowEnlarge=Boolean
                Output_Print_AllowShrink=Boolean
                Output_Print_Center=Boolean
                Output_Print_Timestamp=Boolean
